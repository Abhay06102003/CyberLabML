Good Evening respected Seniors.
My name is Abhay Chourasiya.
I am from Jabalpur,Madhya Pradesh.
I am pursuing Bachelors of Technology in Mining Engineering.
My Hobby is Cycling.

                                                         ML BOOTCAMP!!
Here, I present you the Machine Learning Library.
Contains:
Linear regression.
Polynomial Linear Regression.
Polynomial Logistic Regression.
K-Nearest Neighbor.
K-Mean Clustering.
Neural Network.


And with Datasets applied for Logistic is famous EMNIST-letters Dataset.

Here, The technologies used are:
Firstly I use Python Language to code all these stuff.
Secondly few famous libraries I use are:
Numpy.
Pandas.
Matplotlib.
And IDE I use is Google Colab to code.

As such I learned alot from this project and its a very nice opportunity to be a part of this and I constantly try and will improve myself better and aims to become a best Machine Learning Engineer. So as my next goal is to learn some deep learning with pytorch and also about implementation of tensorflow and much more like keras ETC.

Thankyou for reading this ReadMe.
Have a Nice Day!
